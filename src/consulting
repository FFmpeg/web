  If you're running a business that uses FFmpeg or would like to use FFmpeg,
  you will sometimes want to have an expert, i.e. one of the original
  developers, work with you to figure out an issue, fix a bug or add
  some new feature.

<p class="with-icon">
  <span class="pull-right"><i class="fa fa-users fa-5x"></i></span>
  This page is a list of those FFmpeg developers that are available for
  employment or consulting. The FFmpeg project highly recommends these people
  to be hired by your business. All developers on this list maintain some
  code in FFmpeg,
  which serves as a testimony for their competence. By hiring one of these
  developers, your business can also (indirectly) support the development
  of FFmpeg.
