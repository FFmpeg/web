<h1>Reporting a Bug To The FFmpeg Project</h1>

<p>
First of all, please remember that all the developers working on FFmpeg are
volunteers, we are not paid for analyzing, debugging, fixing and answering
bug reports. While we try our best to create high quality software and be
responsive, if you should not get an answer, please consider the above and
be aware of the fact that we receive many bug reports and the amount of
time it takes to deal with them can be substantial. Nevertheless most issues
get resolved, just please understand that there are no guarantees nor
promises.
</p>

<p>
<b>Before reporting a bug, please consider the following items</b>:
</p>

<p>
FFmpeg is in a state of perpetual development and we do not currently have the
person power to backport fixes to official releases. As such, if you wish to
query or report a bug, you must try with the <b>latest development branch</b> revision of
FFmpeg to confirm the issue still exists.
</p>

<p>
When writing your bug report, please include (uncompressed):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What you were trying to accomplish (e.g., "I am trying to transcode
    from this format to that format...")</li>
  <li>The problem you encountered (e.g., "<code>ffmpeg</code> crashed" or "The
    output video was all green")</li>
  <li>The exact command line you were using (e.g., "<code>ffmpeg -i input.mov
    -an -vcodec foo output.avi</code>")</li>
  <li>The full, uncut console output provided by
    <code>ffmpeg -v 9 -loglevel 99 -i </code> followed by the name of your input file
    (copy/pasted from the console, including the banner that indicates
    version and configuration options), paste <code>ffplay</code> output
    only if your problem is not reproducible with ffmpeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can use the <code>-report</code> option or define the
<code>FFREPORT</code> environment variable (to any value) to get the exact
command line and the full verbose console output in a file named
<code>ffmpeg-*.log</code> in the current directory.
Note that the <code>-report</code> option is recent, it will not help
tracking regressions in old revisions.
</p>

<p>
If you encounter a crash bug, please provide the <code>gdb</code> output,
backtrace and disassembly using the the <code>ffmpeg_g</code> debug binary as
follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>gdb ffmpeg_g</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In <code>gdb</code>, type 'r' for run, along with the rest of the
<code>ffmpeg</code> command line:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>r &lt;rest of command line&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
When <code>gdb</code> encounters its problem, run the following commands and
copy/paste the output into your bug report:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
bt
disass $pc-32,$pc+32
info all-registers
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
With older <code>gdb</code> versions, use <code>disass $pc-32 $pc+32</code>.
</p>

<h2>Bug Tracker</h2>

<p>
Once you have gathered this information, you can submit a report to the
<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg">FFmpeg bug tracker</a>.
Note, you must <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/register">register</a>
there first before you can submit a report.
You should provide all information so that anyone can reproduce the bug.
Please do not report your problem on the developer mailing list:
Only send bug reports there if you also intend to provide a fix.
</p>


<h2>Submitting Sample Media</h2>

<p>
The developers may ask you to provide a sample media file illustrating
your problem. In this case, please follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the sample file is too large ( &gt; 10 megabytes), cut it down to
    size with the Unix 'dd' command:
      <blockquote>
      <pre>dd if=sample-file of=small-sample-file bs=1024 count=10000</pre>
      </blockquote>
    and then upload small-sample-file rather than sample-file</li>
  <li>Please choose descriptive names like "h264_green_tint.mov" or
      "block_artifacts_after_seeking.mkv". We already have plenty of "bug.rm"
      and "sample.avi" to choose from.</li>
  <li>Upload the sample to the MPlayer FTP server. Note that our FTP server
    is write-only, as it would immediately get misused for warez trading
    otherwise. Do not let this confuse you. Even though you cannot see the
    stuff you upload, it will be there and the FFmpeg developers will have
    access.
  <ul>
    <li>Log into upload.ffmpeg.org with an anonymous FTP login.</li>
    <li>cd -> incoming</li>
    <li>Upload a brief text file describing the sample and what is wrong.
        <b>This is important!</b> If you leave out the text file, your
        sample will most likely be deleted without further examination.</li>
    <li>Upload the sample.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email the list and indicate the location of the sample.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Important: Movie files which have been compressed (rar,7z,gzip,...) will be
deleted without being examined unless they are raw RGB/YUV/PCM.</b>
<b>Furthermore movie files uploaded to services like megaupload, rapidshare or
any other similar service will be ignored. We are not willing to spend our
time fighting with this ridiculous, bloated and spam-filled crap.</b>
</p>
