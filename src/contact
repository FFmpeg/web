          Please follow the netiquette when posting on FFmpeg mailing lists, especially
          avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting">top-posting</a> and
          thread hijacking (that is, replying to a thread and changing the subject line to
          something completely unrelated that was not being discussed within the original
          thread) and please read the <a href="community.html#CodeOfConduct">Code of conduct</a>.

        <p>
          Configuring your mail client to break lines after 70 or so characters is a plus.
          If you attach files, avoid compressing small files, uncompressed is preferred.
          Also please try to avoid posting mails with overly long signatures or nonsense
          corporate disclaimers that claim the content of your mails is confidential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attached patches should not have application/octet-stream as mime-type, but
          text/plain or even better text/x-diff or text/x-patch.<br>
          If you send us a patch, please make it some form of unified diff. We prefer
          patches made using <code>git format-patch</code> from the root of your FFmpeg
          checkout or sent with <code>git send-email</code> as shown in
          <a href="git-howto.html">Using git to develop FFmpeg</a>. For additional
          information and guidelines refer to the

          FFmpeg has two official channels on the <a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera</a>
          IRC network. Both channels are open and unmoderated. Maintainers
          have operator status, contributors with patches in FFmpeg
          have voice in the channels.
          <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.libera.chat/?channels=#ffmpeg,#ffmpeg-devel">kiwiirc webchat</a> is a web
          client for these channels.

          Strictly dedicated to FFmpeg development. This means development of FFmpeg
          itself. Development of other software that uses the FFmpeg libraries is offtopic
          there.

      FFmpeg offers no official forum. However, we collect links to FFmpeg-related forums
      found in the world wide web. If you would like to see your forum added here, please
      send an email to the
      <a href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel/">ffmpeg-devel</a>
      mailing list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also if you don't receive a reply on the forums, try our official mailing list or
      IRC channels. And most importantly, if you see questions from others on the forums
      or mailing list that you know the answer to, please help and reply. The forums
      are largely community supported and few official developers read them regularly.
