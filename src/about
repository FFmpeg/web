<h1>About FFmpeg</h1>

<p>FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode,
transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything
that humans and machines have created. It supports the most obscure
ancient formats up to the cutting edge of open and secret proprietary
formats. It contains libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat, libavdevice,
libswscale and libswresample which can be used by applications.
As well as ffmpeg, ffserver, ffplay and ffprobe which can be used by
end users for transcoding, streaming and playing
</p>

<p>The FFmpeg project tries to provide the best technically possible
solution for developers of applications and end users alike. To achieve
this we combine the best free software options available. We slightly
favor our own code to keep the dependencies on other libs low and to
maximize code sharing.
Wherever the question of "best" cannot be answered we support both
options so the end user can choose.
</p>

<p>Security is a high priority and code review is always done with
security in mind. Though due to the very large amounts of code touching
untrusted data security issues are unavoidable and thus we provide
as quick as possible updates to our last stable releases when
new security issues are found.
</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome in FFmpeg and all contributions are welcome too.
We are happy to receive patches, pull requests, bug reports, donations
or any other type of contribution.
