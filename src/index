  <p>
    We published release <b><a href="download.html#release_2.8">2.8</a></b> as new major version. 
    It contains all features and bug fixes of the git master branch from September 8th. Please see 
    the <b><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/master/Changelog">changelog</a></b> 
    for a list of the most important changes.

  <a id="message"></a><h3>August 1st, 2015, A message from the FFmpeg project</h3>
  <p>
    Dear multimedia community,
  </p>
  <p>
    The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has
    come by surprise. He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many
    years and we must thank him for the work that he has done. We hope that in
    the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming
    weeks, the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both
    contributors and users. We should now look to the future, try to find
    solutions to these issues, and to have reconciliation between the forks,
    which have split the community for so long.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate
    venues so far, which has made finding common ground and solutions
    difficult. We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming
    weeks, and in person at the <a
    href="https://www.videolan.org/videolan/events/vdd15/">VideoLAN Developer
    Days</a> in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source
    multimedia community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The FFmpeg project.
  </p>

  <a id="needhost"></a><h3>July 4th, 2015, FFmpeg needs a new host</h3>
  <p><b>UPDATE:</b> We have received more than 7 offers for hosting and servers, thanks a lot to everyone!</p>
  <p>
    After graciously hosting our projects (<a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a>, <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">MPlayer</a>
    and <a href="http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu">rtmpdump</a>) for 4 years, Arpi (our hoster) has informed us that we have to secure a new host somewhere else immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to host an open source project, please let us know, either on <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel">ffmpeg-devel</a>
    mailing list or irc.freenode.net #ffmpeg-devel.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use about 4TB of storage and at least 4TB of bandwidth / month for various mailing lists, <a href="http://trac.ffmpeg.org">trac</a>, <a href="http://samples.ffmpeg.org">samples repo</a>, svn, etc.
  </p>

  <a id="clt2015"></a><h3>March 1, 2015, Chemnitzer Linux-Tage</h3>
  <p>
    We happily announce that FFmpeg will be represented at Chemnitzer Linux-Tage
    (CLT) in Chemnitz, Germany. The event will take place on 21st and 22nd of March.
  </p>

  <p>
    More information can be found <a href="https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2015/en/">here</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    We demonstrate usage of FFmpeg, answer your questions and listen to
    your problems and wishes. <strong>If you have media files that cannot be
    processed correctly with FFmpeg, be sure to have a sample with you
    so we can have a look!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    For the first time in our CLT history, there will be an <strong>FFmpeg workshop</strong>!
    You can read the details <a href="https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2015/de/programm/beitrag/209">here</a>.
    The workshop is targeted at FFmpeg beginners. First the basics of
    multimedia will be covered. Thereafter you will learn how to use
    that knowledge and the FFmpeg CLI tools to analyse and process media
    files. The workshop is in German language only and prior registration
    is necessary. The workshop will be on Saturday starting at 10 o'clock.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are looking forward to meet you (again)!

  <a id="pr2.5"></a><h3>December 5, 2014, FFmpeg 2.5</h3>
  <p>
    We have made a new major release (<b><a href="download.html#release_2.5">2.5</a></b>)
    It contains all features and bugfixes of the git master branch from the 4th December.

  <a id="ffmpeg_back_in_sid"></a><h3>October 10, 2014, FFmpeg is in Debian unstable again</h3>
  <p>
    We wanted you to know there are
    <a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=ffmpeg&amp;searchon=sourcenames&amp;suite=unstable&amp;section=main">
    FFmpeg packages in Debian unstable</a> again. <strong>A big thank-you
    to Andreas Cadhalpun and all the people that made it possible.</strong> It has been anything but simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately that was already the easy part of this news. The bad news is the packages probably won't
    migrate to Debian testing to be in the upcoming release codenamed jessie.
    <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763148">Read the argumentation over at Debian.</a>

  </p>

  <a id="opw03"></a><h3>October 8, 2014, FFmpeg secured a place in OPW!</h3>
  <p>
    Thanks to a generous 6K USD donation by Samsung (Open Source Group),
    FFmpeg will be welcoming at least 1 "Outreach Program for Women" intern
    to work with our community for an initial period starting December 2014
    (through March 2015).
  </p>

  <p>
    We all know FFmpeg is used by the industry, but even while there are
    countless products building on our code, it is not at all common for
    companies to step up and help us out when needed. So a big thank-you
    to Samsung and the OPW program committee!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are thinking on participating in OPW as an intern, please take
    a look at our <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/OPW/2014-12">OPW wiki page</a>
    for some initial guidelines. The page is still a work in progress, but
    there should be enough information there to get you started. If you, on
    the other hand, are thinking on sponsoring work on FFmpeg through the
    OPW program, please get in touch with us at opw@ffmpeg.org. With your
    help, we might be able to secure some extra intern spots for this round!
  </p>

  <a id="pr2.4"></a><h3>September 15, 2014, FFmpeg 2.4</h3>

    OPW (Outreach Program for Women), we are now reaching out to our users
    (both individuals and companies) to help us gather the needed money to
    secure our spot in the program.<br>
    We need to put together 6K USD as a minimum but securing more funds would
    help us towards getting more than one intern.<br>
    You can donate by credit card using
    <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=56226">
    Click&amp;Pledge</a> and selecting the "OPW" option. If you would like to

  <p>
    The FFmpeg project is proud to announce a brand new version of the website
    made by <a href="http://db0.fr">db0</a>. While this was initially motivated
    by the need for a larger menu, the whole website ended up being redesigned,
    and most pages got reworked to ease navigation. We hope you'll enjoy

  <a id="opw01"></a><h3>July 3, 2014, FFmpeg and the Outreach Program For Women</h3>
  <p>
    FFmpeg has started the process to become an OPW includer organization for the
    next round of the program, with internships starting December 9. The
    <a href="https://gnome.org/opw/">OPW</a> aims to "Help women (cis and trans)
    and genderqueer to get involved in free and open source software". Part of the
    process requires securing funds to support at least one internship (6K USD), so
    if you were holding on your donation to FFmpeg, this is a great chance for you
    to come forward, get in touch and help both the project and a great initiative!
  </p>
  <p>
    We have set up an <a href="mailto:opw@ffmpeg.org">email address</a> you can use
    to contact us about donations and general inquires regarding our participation
    in the program. Hope to hear from you soon!

  <a id="heartbleed"></a><h3>April 18, 2014, OpenSSL Heartbeat bug</h3>
  <p>
    Our server hosting the Trac issue tracker was vulnerable to the attack
    against OpenSSL known as "heartbleed". The OpenSSL software library
    was updated on 7th of April, shortly after the vulnerability was publicly
    disclosed. We have changed the private keys (and certificates) for all
    FFmpeg servers. The details were sent to the mailing lists by
    Alexander Strasser, who is part of the project server team. Here is a
    link to the user mailing list
    <a href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2014-April/020968.html">archive</a>
    .
  </p><p>
    We encourage you to read up on
    <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/heartbleed.html">"OpenSSL heartbleed"</a>.
    <b>It is possible that login data for the issue tracker was exposed to
      people exploiting this security hole. You might want to change your password
      in the tracker and everywhere else you used that same password.</b>

  <a id="trac_sec"></a><h3>February 9, 2014, trac.ffmpeg.org / trac.mplayerhq.hu Security Breach</h3>
  <p>
    The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
    installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
    and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
    FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
    and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
    to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
    That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
    Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend all users to change their passwords.
    <b>Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use
      elsewhere, should change that password at least elsewhere.</b>
  </p>


  <a id="ffmpeg_rfp"></a><h3>November 12, 2013, FFmpeg RFP in Debian</h3>
  <p>
    Since the splitting of Libav the Debian/Ubuntu maintainers have followed
    the Libav fork. Many people have requested the packaging of ffmpeg in
    Debian, as it is more feature-complete and in many cases less buggy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://cynic.cc/blog/">Rogério Brito</a>, a Debian developer,
    has proposed a Request For Package (RFP) in the Debian bug tracking
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please let the Debian and Ubuntu developers know that you support packaging
    of the real FFmpeg! See Debian <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729203">ticket #729203</a>
    for more details.
