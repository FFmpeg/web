<a id="heartbleed"></a><h3>April 18, 2014, OpenSSL Heartbeat bug</h3>
<p>
Our server hosting the Trac issue tracker was vulnerable to the attack
against OpenSSL known as "heartbleed". The OpenSSL software library
was updated on 7th of April, shortly after the vulnerability was publicly
disclosed. We have changed the private keys (and certificates) for all
FFmpeg servers. The details were sent to the mailing lists by
Alexander Strasser, who is part of the project server team. Here is a
link to the user mailing list
<a href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2014-April/020968.html">archive</a>
.
</p><p>
We encourage you to read up on
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/heartbleed.html">"OpenSSL heartbleed"</a>.
<b>It is possible that login data for the issue tracker was exposed to
people exploiting this security hole. You might want to change your password
in the tracker and everywhere else you used that same password.</b>
</p>

<p>
We happily announce that FFmpeg will be represented at `Chemnitzer Linux-Tage'
in Chemnitz, Germany. The event will take place on 15th and 16th of March.

<a id="trac_sec"></a><h3>February 9, 2014, trac.ffmpeg.org / trac.mplayerhq.hu Security Breach</h3>
<p>
The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.
</p>
<p>
We recommend all users to change their passwords.
<b>Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use
elsewhere, should change that password at least elsewhere.</b>
</p>


<a id="ffmpeg_rfp"></a><h3>November 12, 2013, FFmpeg RFP in Debian</h3>
<p>
Since the splitting of Libav the Debian/Ubuntu maintainers have followed
the Libav fork. Many people have requested the packaging of ffmpeg in
Debian, as it is more feature-complete and in many cases less buggy.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://cynic.cc/blog/">Rogério Brito</a>, a Debian developer,
has proposed a Request For Package (RFP) in the Debian bug tracking
system.
</p>
<p>
Please let the Debian and Ubuntu developers know that you support packaging
of the real FFmpeg! See Debian <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729203">ticket #729203</a>
for more details.
</p>

<a id="news-30122012"></a><h3>December 30, 2012, Recent Developments</h3>
<p>
Before this year ends we want to use the occasion and give you some news about
recent developments in FFmpeg.
</p>

<h4>
- <a href="/ffmpeg-filters.html#subtitles">subtitles filter</a>
</h4>
<p>
The subtitles filter makes it possible to merge subtitles supported by
libavformat/libavcodec into a video stream. This process is also known
as burning them into the video or simply hardsubbing. This filter depends
on libass and thus is only available in builds configured with --enable-ass.
</p>
<p>
The subtitles filter is also useful to play external subtitle files with
ffplay. An example of this usage can be found in the following entry about
TED captions.
</p>

<h4>
- JSON <a href="ffmpeg-formats.html#tedcaptions">captions for TED talks</a> decoding support
</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> provides video downloads for their talks.
Not all of these are available with subtitles and when they are the subtitles
are burnt into the video. Now with this new FFmpeg feature you can download the
subtitle files and just display them on the fly when playing the video with ffplay:
</p>
<pre>
  ffplay ted.mp4 -vf subtitles=ted.json
</pre>

<h4>
- <a href="/ffmpeg-filters.html#geq">geq filter</a> ported from libmpcodecs
</h4>
<p>
This is another filter ported from MPlayer. It allows you to arbitrarily
change luma and chroma values for each pixel of the movie individually.
To learn more look at the
<a href="/ffmpeg-filters.html#geq">geq documentation</a>
and
<a href="ffmpeg-utils.html#Expression-Evaluation">the evaluation syntax description</a>.
Do not forget to give it a try:
</p>
<pre>
  ffplay input.movie -vf "geq=p(X\,Y):if(gt(Y\,H/2)\,128)+ifnot(gt(Y\,H/2)\,cr(X\,Y)):if(gt(Y\,H/2)\,128)+ifnot(gt(Y\,H/2)\,cb(X\,Y))"
</pre>

<h4>
- filter for <a href="/ffmpeg-filters.html#ebur128">loudness analysis following EBU R128</a>
</h4>
<p>
This filter analyses audio streams as recommended by EBU recommendation R128.
The output can be either logged or visualized in a generated video stream.
</p>

<h4>
- <a href="/ffserver.html#What-is-FFM_002c-FFM2">FFM2</a> support
</h4>
<p>
The FFM2 format has been introduced to provide better interoperability
between different versions of the FFmpeg tools. It is usually used to
provide input to ffserver. It improves on its predecessor FFM by making
the format backward-compatible and extensible. This means the generated
files are are no longer dependant on specific FFmpeg versions.
</p>

<h4>
- Opus encoder using libopus
</h4>
<p>
You can encode Opus now via Xiph's
<a href="http://opus-codec.org/development/">libopus</a>.
</p>

<h4>
- VobSub demuxer
</h4>
<p>
IDX/SUB file pairs can now be played back or be remuxed into other formats such as MKV.
</p>

<h4>
- Resolution &amp; pixel format change support with multithreading for H.264
</h4>
<p>
Finally H.264 with resolution and/or pixel format changes can be decoded multithreaded.
</p>

<h4>
- <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> split into per-component manuals
</h4>
<p>
In an on-going effort, the documentation is split, reordered and extended
to make it more accessible and more complete.
</p>

<p>
Of course we can't possibly cover all changes since our last release in a single news
article, but we encourage you to read the
<a href="http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=Changelog">Changelog</a>
yourself.
</p>

<p>
<i>We wish you all a happy new year!</i>
