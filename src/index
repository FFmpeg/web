  <h3 id="sdl1">September 24th, 2016, SDL1 support dropped.</h3>
  <p>
    Support for the SDL1 library has been dropped, due to it no longer being maintained (as of
    January, 2012) and it being superseded by the SDL2 library. As a result, the SDL1 output device
    has also been removed and replaced by an SDL2 implementation. Both the ffplay and opengl output
    devices have been updated to support SDL2.

  <h3 id="pr3.1.2">August 9th, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1.2 "Laplace"</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="download.html#release_3.1">FFmpeg 3.1.2</a>, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It fixes several bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  </p>
  <h3 id="ffserv">July 10th, 2016, ffserver program being dropped</h3>
  <p>
    After thorough deliberation, we're announcing that we're about to drop the ffserver program from the project starting with the next release.
    ffserver has been a problematic program to maintain due to its use of internal APIs, which complicated the recent cleanups to the libavformat
    library, and block further cleanups and improvements which are desired by API users and will be easier to maintain. Furthermore the program has
    been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax.
    Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs
    and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.

  <h3 id="removing_external_aac_encoders">January 30, 2016, Removing support for two external AAC encoders</h3>
  <p>
    We have just removed support for VisualOn AAC encoder (libvo-aacenc) and
    libaacplus in FFmpeg master.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even before marking our internal AAC encoder as
    <a href="#aac_encoder_stable">stable</a>, it was known that libvo-aacenc
    was of an inferior quality compared to our native one for most samples.
    However, the VisualOn encoder was used extensively by the Android Open
    Source Project, and we would like to have a tested-and-true stable option
    in our code base.
  </p>
  <p>
    When first committed in 2011, libaacplus filled in the gap of encoding
    High Efficiency AAC formats (HE-AAC and HE-AACv2), which was not supported
    by any of the encoders in FFmpeg at that time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The circumstances for both have changed. After the work spearheaded by
    Rostislav Pehlivanov and Claudio Freire, the now-stable FFmpeg native AAC
    encoder is ready to compete with much more mature encoders. The Fraunhofer
    FDK AAC Codec Library for Android was added in 2012 as the fourth
    supported external AAC encoder, and the one with the best quality and the
    most features supported, including HE-AAC and HE-AACv2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, we have decided that it is time to remove libvo-aacenc and
    libaacplus. If you are currently using libvo-aacenc, prepare to transition
    to the native encoder (<code>aac</code>) when updating to the next version
    of FFmpeg. In most cases it is as simple as merely swapping the encoder
    name. If you are currently using libaacplus, start using FDK AAC
    (<code>libfdk_aac</code>) with an appropriate <code>profile</code> option
    to select the exact AAC profile that fits your needs. In both cases, you
    will enjoy an audible quality improvement and as well as fewer licensing
    headaches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enjoy!
  </p>

  <h3 id="pr2.8.5">January 16, 2016, FFmpeg 2.8.5, 2.7.5, 2.6.7, 2.5.10</h3>
  <p>
    We have made several new point releases (<b><a href="download.html#release_2.8">2.8.5</a>,
      <a href="download.html#release_2.7">2.7.5</a>,
      <a href="download.html#release_2.6">2.6.7</a>,
      <a href="download.html#release_2.5">2.5.10</a></b>).
    They fix various bugs, as well as CVE-2016-1897 and CVE-2016-1898.
    Please see the changelog for each release for more details.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use
    current git master.
  </p>

  <h3 id="aac_encoder_stable">December 5th, 2015, The native FFmpeg AAC encoder is now stable!</h3>
  <p>
    After seven years the native FFmpeg AAC encoder has had its experimental flag
    removed and declared as ready for general use. The encoder is transparent
    at 128kbps for most samples tested with artifacts only appearing in extreme
    cases. Subjective quality tests put the encoder to be of equal or greater
    quality than most of the other encoders available to the public.
  </p>
  <p>
    Licensing has always been an issue with encoding AAC audio as most of the
    encoders have had a license making FFmpeg unredistributable if compiled with
    support for them. The fact that there now exists a fully open and truly
    free AAC encoder integrated directly within the project means a lot to those
    who wish to use accepted and widespread standards.
  </p>
  <p>
    The majority of the work done to bring the encoder up to quality was started
    during this year's GSoC by developer Claudio Freire and Rostislav Pehlivanov.
    Both continued to work on the encoder with the latter joining as a developer
    and mainainer, working on other parts of the project as well. Also, thanks
    to <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kamedo2/">Kamedo2</a> who does comparisons
    and tests, the original authors and all past and current contributors to the
    encoder. Users are suggested and encouraged to use the encoder and provide
    feedback or breakage reports through our <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/">bug tracker</a>.

  <h3 id="gsoc2015_result">September 29th, 2015, GSoC 2015 results</h3>

  <p>
    FFmpeg participated to the latest edition of
    the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015">Google
    Summer of Code</a> Project. FFmpeg got a total of 8 assigned

  </p>

  <p>We want to thank <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>, the
    participating students, and especially the mentors who joined this
    effort. We're looking forward to participating in the next GSoC
    edition!
  </p>

  <p>
    Below you can find a brief description of the final outcome of
    each single project.
  </p>

  <h4>Basic servers for network protocols, mentee: Stephan Holljes, mentor: Nicolas George</h4>

  <p>
    Stephan Holljes's project for this session of Google Summer of Code was to
    implement basic HTTP server features for libavformat, to complement the
    already present HTTP client and RTMP and RTSP server code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first part of the project was to make the HTTP code capable of accepting
    a single client; it was completed partly during the qualification period and
    partly during the first week of the summer. Thanks to this work, it is now
    possible to make a simple HTTP stream using the following commands:
  </p>

  <pre>
    ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -listen 1 -f matroska \
    -c:v libx264 -preset fast -tune zerolatency http://:8080
    ffplay http://localhost:8080/
  </pre>

  <p>
    The next part of the project was to extend the code to be able to accept
    several clients, simultaneously or consecutively. Since libavformat did not
    have an API for that kind of task, it was necessary to design one. This part
    was mostly completed before the midterm and applied shortly afterwards.
    Since the ffmpeg command-line tool is not ready to serve several clients,
    the test ground for that new API is an example program serving hard-coded
    content.
  </p>

  <p>
    The last and most ambitious part of the project was to update ffserver to
    make use of the new API. It would prove that the API is usable to implement
    real HTTP servers, and expose the points where more control was needed. By
    the end of the summer, a first working patch series was undergoing code
    review.
  </p>

  <h4>Browsing content on the server, mentee: Mariusz Szczepańczyk, mentor: Lukasz Marek</h4>

  <p>
    Mariusz finished an API prepared by the FFmpeg community and implemented
    Samba directory listing as qualification task.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the program he extended the API with the possibility to
    remove and rename files on remote servers. He completed the
    implementation of these features for file, Samba, SFTP, and FTP
    protocols.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the program, Mariusz provided a sketch of an
    implementation for HTTP directory listening.
  </p>

  <h4>Directshow digital video capture, mentee: Mate Sebok, mentor: Roger Pack</h4>

  <p>
    Mate was working on directshow input from digital video sources. He
    got working input from ATSC input sources, with specifiable tuner.
  </p>

  <p>
    The code has not been committed, but a patch of it was sent to the
    ffmpeg-devel mailing list for future use.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mentor plans on cleaning it up and committing it, at least for the
    ATSC side of things. Mate and the mentor are still working trying to
    finally figure out how to get DVB working.
  </p>

  <h4>Implementing full support for 3GPP Timed Text Subtitles, mentee: Niklesh Lalwani, mentor: Philip Langdale</h4>

  <p>
    Niklesh's project was to expand our support for 3GPP Timed Text
    subtitles. This is the native subtitle format for mp4 containers, and
    is interesting because it's usually the only subtitle format supported
    by the stock playback applications on iOS and Android devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    ffmpeg already had basic support for these subtitles which ignored all
    formatting information - it just provided basic plain-text support.
  </p>

  <p>
    Niklesh did work to add support on both the encode and decode side for
    text formatting capabilities, such as font size/colour and effects like
    bold/italics, highlighting, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main challenge here is that Timed Text handles formatting in a very
    different way from most common subtitle formats. It uses a binary
    encoding (based on mp4 boxes, naturally) and stores information
    separately from the text itself. This requires additional work to track
    which parts of the text formatting applies to, and explicitly dealing
    with overlapping formatting (which other formats support but Timed
    Text does not) so it requires breaking the overlapping sections into
    separate non-overlapping ones with different formatting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, Niklesh had to be careful about not trusting any size
    information in the subtitles - and that's no joke: the now infamous
    Android stagefright bug was in code for parsing Timed Text subtitles.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of Niklesh's work is committed and was released in ffmpeg 2.8.
  </p>

<h4>libswscale refactoring, mentee: Pedro Arthur, mentors: Michael Niedermayer, Ramiro Polla</h4>

  <p>
    Pedro Arthur has modularized the vertical and horizontal scalers.
    To do this he designed and implemented a generic filter framework
    and moved the existing scaler code into it. These changes now allow
    easily adding removing, splitting or merging processing steps.
    The implementation was benchmarked and several alternatives were
    tried to avoid speed loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    He also added gamma corrected scaling support.
    An example to use gamma corrected scaling would be:
  </p>

  <pre>
    ffmpeg -i input -vf scale=512:384:gamma=1 output
  </pre>

  <p>
    Pedro has done impressive work considering the short time available,
    and he is a FFmpeg committer now. He continues to contribute to
    FFmpeg, and has fixed some bugs in libswscale after GSoC has
    ended.
  </p>

  <h4>AAC Encoder Improvements, mentee: Rostislav Pehlivanov, mentor: Claudio Freire</h4>

  <p>
    Rostislav Pehlivanov has implemented PNS, TNS, I/S coding and main
    prediction on the native AAC encoder. Of all those extensions, only
    TNS was left in a less-than-usable state, but the implementation has
    been pushed (disabled) anyway since it's a good basis for further
    improvements.
  </p>

  <p>
    PNS replaces noisy bands with a single scalefactor representing the
    energy of that band, gaining in coding efficiency considerably, and
    the quality improvements on low bitrates are impressive for such a
    simple feature.
  </p>

  <p>
    TNS still needs some polishing, but has the potential to reduce coding
    artifacts by applying noise shaping in the temporal domain (something
    that is a source of annoying, notable distortion on low-entropy
    bands).
  </p>

  <p>
    Intensity Stereo coding (I/S) can double coding efficiency by
    exploiting strong correlation between stereo channels, most effective
    on pop-style tracks that employ panned mixing. The technique is not as
    effective on classic X-Y recordings though.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, main prediction improves coding efficiency by exploiting
    correlation among successive frames. While the gains have not been
    huge at this point, Rostislav has remained active even after the GSoC,
    and is polishing both TNS and main prediction, as well as looking for
    further improvements to make.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the process, the MIPS port of the encoder was broken a few times,
    something he's also working to fix.
  </p>

  <h4>Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG), mentee: Donny Yang, mentor: Paul B Mahol</h4>

  <p>
    Donny Yang implemented basic keyframe only APNG encoder as the
    qualification task. Later he wrote interframe compression via
    various blend modes. The current implementation tries all blend
    modes and picks one which takes the smallest amount of memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Special care was taken to make sure that the decoder plays
    correctly all files found in the wild and that the encoder
    produces files that can be played in browsers that support APNG.
  </p>

  <p>
    During his work he was tasked to fix any encountered bug in the
    decoder due to the fact that it doesn't match APNG
    specifications. Thanks to this work, a long standing bug in the
    PNG decoder has been fixed.
  </p>

  <p>
    For latter work he plans to continue working on the encoder,
    making it possible to select which blend modes will be used in the
    encoding process. This could speed up encoding of APNG files.
  </p>

  <h3 id="message">August 1st, 2015, A message from the FFmpeg project</h3>
  <p>
    Dear multimedia community,
  </p>
  <p>
    The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has
    come by surprise. He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many
    years and we must thank him for the work that he has done. We hope that in
    the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming
    weeks, the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both
    contributors and users. We should now look to the future, try to find
    solutions to these issues, and to have reconciliation between the forks,
    which have split the community for so long.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate
    venues so far, which has made finding common ground and solutions
    difficult. We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming
    weeks, and in person at the <a
    href="https://www.videolan.org/videolan/events/vdd15/">VideoLAN Developer
    Days</a> in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source
    multimedia community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The FFmpeg project.

    FFmpeg packages in Debian unstable</a> again. <strong>A big thank-you
    to Andreas Cadhalpun and all the people that made it possible.</strong> It has been anything but simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately that was already the easy part of this news. The bad news is the packages probably won't
    migrate to Debian testing to be in the upcoming release codenamed jessie.

  <h3 id="opw03">October 8, 2014, FFmpeg secured a place in OPW!</h3>
  <p>
    Thanks to a generous 6K USD donation by Samsung (Open Source Group),
    FFmpeg will be welcoming at least 1 "Outreach Program for Women" intern
    to work with our community for an initial period starting December 2014
    (through March 2015).
  </p>

  <p>
    We all know FFmpeg is used by the industry, but even while there are
    countless products building on our code, it is not at all common for
    companies to step up and help us out when needed. So a big thank-you
    to Samsung and the OPW program committee!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are thinking on participating in OPW as an intern, please take
    a look at our <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/OPW/2014-12">OPW wiki page</a>
    for some initial guidelines. The page is still a work in progress, but
    there should be enough information there to get you started. If you, on
    the other hand, are thinking on sponsoring work on FFmpeg through the
    OPW program, please get in touch with us at opw@ffmpeg.org. With your
    help, we might be able to secure some extra intern spots for this round!

    (both individuals and companies) to help us gather the needed money to
    secure our spot in the program.<br>

  <h3 id="heartbleed">April 18, 2014, OpenSSL Heartbeat bug</h3>

    was updated on 7th of April, shortly after the vulnerability was publicly
    disclosed. We have changed the private keys (and certificates) for all
    FFmpeg servers. The details were sent to the mailing lists by
    Alexander Strasser, who is part of the project server team. Here is a
    link to the user mailing list
    <a href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2014-April/020968.html">archive</a>

  <h3 id="trac_sec">February 9, 2014, trac.ffmpeg.org / trac.mplayerhq.hu Security Breach</h3>
  <p>
    The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
    installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
    and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
    FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
    and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
    to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
    That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
    Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend all users to change their passwords.
    <b>Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use
      elsewhere, should change that password at least elsewhere.</b>

  <h3 id="ffmpeg_rfp">November 12, 2013, FFmpeg RFP in Debian</h3>
  <p>
    Since the splitting of Libav the Debian/Ubuntu maintainers have followed

  <p>
    <a href="http://cynic.cc/blog/">Rogério Brito</a>, a Debian developer,
    has proposed a Request For Package (RFP) in the Debian bug tracking
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please let the Debian and Ubuntu developers know that you support packaging
    of the real FFmpeg! See Debian <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729203">ticket #729203</a>
